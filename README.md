# Visualize Things

Mixed reality 3D model viewer for the Meta Quest 3 family.

Uses Quest 3 specific features to make 3D models blend in realistically with the environment.

Made in Unity.

This uses the paid [TriLib 2 asset](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/modeling/trilib-2-model-loading-package-157548?srsltid=AfmBOoqjkptm8kh3QdliqEHWGOn1LThKZJmY-kS-YAhbv9NIVoi-nUiM). You'll need to purchase that and import it into the project yourself for this to work in the Unity Editor.

By the way the working title was "Realivation"; that name hasn't been gotten rid of in the code entirely yet.
